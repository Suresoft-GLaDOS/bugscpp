`Defects4Cpp` is another collection of reproducible bugs for C/C++ and a supporting infrastructure with the goal of automatic program debugging research
inspired by `Defects4J`_.

Installation
============
.. begin installation

Docker daemon must be running in background in order to run.

.. end installation

Example
=======
.. begin example

A list of defect taxonomy can be displayed via the following:

::

    python3 defects4cpp/d++.py show

For the rest commands to work, you need to checkout one of projects in the list displayed in the previous step.
For instance, if you want to checkout `wget2` project:

::

    $ python3 defects4cpp/d++.py checkout wget2 1

Finally, to build and test `wget2`, or any project you've just cloned, run the following sequence of commands:

::

    $ python3 defects4cpp/d++.py build /path/to/wget2/fixed#1
    $ python3 defects4cpp/d++.py test /path/to/wget2/fixed#1

You can run some test cases separately like this:

::

    $ python3 defects4cpp/d++.py test /path/to/wget2/fixed#1 --case 1-4,7

However, you are probably interested in a snapshot where a buggy commit is just made.
The command is exactly the same except that ``--buggy`` flag is set.

::

    $ python3 defects4cpp/d++.py checkout wget2 1 --buggy

Set ``--coverage`` to generate `.gcov` data.

::

    $ python3 defects4cpp/d++.py build /path/to/wget2/buggy#1 --coverage
    $ python3 defects4cpp/d++.py test /path/to/wget2/buggy#1 --coverage

You'll see the artifact is generated in the current directory.

::

    $ ls
    /path/to/wget2-fixed#1-1
    /path/to/wget2-fixed#1-2
    /path/to/wget2-fixed#1-3
    ...
